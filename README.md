# U-SegTime
Figure generation code for the paper "U-SegTime: A Time Series Segmentation Model for Detecting High-Voltage Direct Current Interference Events in Geomagnetic Field Observation Data"

README: Code for Figure Generation (U-SegTime Paper)

This archive contains the Python source code used to generate the visualization results shown in Figures 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the manuscript titled:
"U-SegTime: A deep learning architecture for precise time series segmentation applied to geomagnetic field observation data".

File List:
- figure6+7+10.py : Generates the visualization results for Figures 6, 7, and 10.
- figure8.py      : Generates the visualization results for Figure 8.
- figure9.py      : Generates the comparison plot of detection performance shown in Figure 9.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- matplotlib
- numpy
- tensorflow (if model loading is required)
- sklearn

Usage:
Each script can be executed independently from the command line:
    python figure6+7+10.py
    python figure8.py
    python figure9.py

Each script will generate and save the corresponding figures in the current working directory.

If you encounter any issues running the code or reproducing the figures, please contact the corresponding author.
